# Docker-Kafka-2-SplunkEE

This is a fork of https://github.com/guilhemmarchand/kafka-docker-splunk that trims down the larger original lab and provides a minimal environment to allow the testing/proof of concept of sending data from a Zookeeper-Kafka instance/cluster to Splunk Enterprise Edition.

While the original lab provides 2 options for hosting Splunk (local instance on host or on docker), this proof of concept focuses only on using Docker. The goal is that with 1 clone command and 1 docker compose up command you are ready to go after a few minutes, and can see Kafka data in the Splunk instance. 

Prerequisites: 
      
      - Docker Desktop (Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux) 
      - Docker Compose (if not already packaged with Docker)

How to Use:

      - TBD
